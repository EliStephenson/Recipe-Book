    <h1>Vegan Bacon</h1>\
    <p><img src="../images/veganbacon.jpg" alt="A picture of a vegan BLT"></p>
    <p>Sometimes your stomache just wants a sandwich and there are few sandos on my list
        that can even be compared to a nice BAT. Before I went vegan I did not particularly
        enjoy BLT's, whether it was because they were not very healthy or that I tought of
        bacon as a breakfast exclusive, but after this sandwhich... lemme tell you. I was a 
        changed man. The avacodo, bacon, heirloom tomato, and <a href="/recipes/lemon-basil-aioli.html">lemon basil aioli</a>all sing 
        together in harmony and the sauce used for the bacon is so good it's hard not to just drink plain.
        This is a quick and easy recipe and if you're like me having this with a side of chips 
        is the way to go.
