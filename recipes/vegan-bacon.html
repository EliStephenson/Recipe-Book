    <h1>Vegan Bacon</h1>\
    <p><img src="../images/veganbacon.jpg" alt="A picture of a vegan BLT"></p>
    <p>Sometimes your stomache just wants a sandwich and there are few sandos on my list
        that can even be compared to a nice BAT. Before I went vegan I did not particularly
        enjoy BLT's, whether it was because they were not very healthy or that I tought of
        bacon as a breakfast exclusive, but after this sandwhich... lemme tell you. I was a 
        changed man. The avacodo, bacon, heirloom tomato, and lemon basil all sing together in
        harmony and the sauce used for the bacon is so good it's hard not to just drink plain.
        This is a quick and easy recipe and if you're like me having this with a side of chips 
        is the way to go.

        <h2> Time to Cook!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To roast the garlic bulb, preheat oven to 425°F. Trim about a 1/4“ off the top of the 
                bulb to expose the cloves. Drizzle with a teaspoon of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt. 
                Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until roasted, golden brown, and soft on the inside.</li>
            <li>Rinse and drain the soaked cashews. Add to a high-powered blender with the roasted cloves 
                of garlic, water, coconut oil, and sea salt. Blend until very smooth and refrigerate 
                to firm up a little bit more like a whipped butter.</li>
            <li>Toss whole potatoes in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, fresh thyme, sea salt, and ground black
                pepper. Bake in an oven preheated to 450°F for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Smash the whole potatoes with a fork or potato masher to break open the skin. Drizzle 
                with another 2 teaspoons of olive oil and place whole thyme sprigs on top so they can 
                crisp up as well. Bake again for another 10 to 12 minutes until crispy.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with a dollop roasted garlic cashew butter on each potato.</li>
        </ol>
