    <p class="intro">What are you eating tonight? do you want a recipe that fills your soul with 
        potatoey and cremey goodness? Well then this recipe is the perfect one for you.
        Tonight we are making smashed potatoes with a roasted garlic butter. Don't worry
        it's not real butter, we are going to make it out of cashews and a little coconut oil.
        If you are looking for a side to this dish than I cannot recommend roasted <a></a>
        brusselsprouts with parmesan enough to round out the meal making you feel both happy and a little healthy
        too. This recipe is super easy but it does take about an hour so you may want to save in
        if you're already getting hungry.

        <h2>What We Will Need</h3>

            <li>1 tbsp coconut oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Smashed Potatoes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>6-7 Cfingerling potatoes (you can also use white or red baby potatoes)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp + 2 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2> Time to Cook!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To roast the garlic bulb, preheat oven to 425°F. Trim about a 1/4“ off the top of the 
                bulb to expose the cloves. Drizzle with a teaspoon of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt. 
                Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until roasted, golden brown, and soft on the inside.</li>
            <li>Rinse and drain the soaked cashews. Add to a high-powered blender with the roasted cloves 
                of garlic, water, coconut oil, and sea salt. Blend until very smooth and refrigerate 
                to firm up a little bit more like a whipped butter.</li>
            <li>Toss whole potatoes in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, fresh thyme, sea salt, and ground black
                pepper. Bake in an oven preheated to 450°F for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Smash the whole potatoes with a fork or potato masher to break open the skin. Drizzle 
                with another 2 teaspoons of olive oil and place whole thyme sprigs on top so they can 
                crisp up as well. Bake again for another 10 to 12 minutes until crispy.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with a dollop roasted garlic cashew butter on each potato.</li>
        </ol>
